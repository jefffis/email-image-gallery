# email-image-gallery
An image gallery that works great in modern email clients, and automagically falls back perfectly for others (i.e. Outlook, Gmail, etc.). Check out the [Litmus test](https://litmus.com/pub/424a9cd) for email results.

Inspired by [this pen](http://codepen.io/aromayne/pen/zGmgRw) by [aromayne](http://codepen.io/aromayne/).

**Note:** this must be run through a [CSS inliner](https://inliner.cm/) before being sent, as many programs strip non-inlined CSS.
